    <h2>With an explosion of technology people face new issues,
      Chapter 2 focuses on the issue of internet privacy and how
      personal information is collected by a myriad of sources, the
      chapter also explains the causes and effects of this new
      development; some being positive while others negative.Internet privacy is certainly hard to come by. Social media
      allows people to share public and "private" information about
      others. Maintaining privacy is expensive and time-consuming,
      so for most people, it's not worth it. After all, why hide from
      the public if you have nothing to hide?</h2>
