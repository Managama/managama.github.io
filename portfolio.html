    <h2>With an explosion of technology people face new issues,
      Chapter 2 focuses on the issue of internet privacy and how
      personal information is collected by a myriad of sources, the
      chapter also explains the causes and effects of this new
      development; some being positive while others negative.Internet privacy is certainly hard to come by. Social media
      allows people to share public and "private" information about
      others. Maintaining privacy is expensive and time-consuming,
      so for most people, it's not worth it. After all, why hide from
      the public if you have nothing to hide?</h2>
      
      <h1>Branching Questions</h1>
      <h3>1. if you write a small amount of code at a time then you can easily got back to where you messed up. If you wrote a huge wall of code and
      suddenly things don't work then you have to go on a wild goose chase to find out the problem</h3>
      <h3>2.It's similar to the robotics club because usually the first design for the robot needs to be improved over and over. so much like a coding it's
      a process of trial and error</h3>
      <h3>4.If it jumps back and forth between all the different programs it can appear to be doing ten processes at once. I can't really think of any other
      way how this would happen.</h3>

    <h3>Conclusion Questions for 1.3.4</h3>
    <p>1. The relationship between if statements and glassbox testing is that the test runs itself through all the if statements to make sure the code works.</p>
    <p>2. I assume as many can be executed as are in the code, I dont recall a limit being mentioned in the assignment.</p>
    <p>3. Personally I really dont like the test sweets but my guess would be that they are coded first so the programmer doesnt have to change all of his code after its already done..</p>
    
    <h3>Conclusion Questions for 1.2.2</h3>
    <p> 1. I'd say this is simlar to scratch in the way that you drag and drop blocks to code the program. Not 100% sure what the secong part of the question is asking but 
    I guess sprites arent in the script area but in there own little sprite room.</p>
    <p>2. Well if anybody has the ability to create and change things on phones than it will hopefully lead to a lot of good ideas being shared and innovations being made at a far more
    rapid pace.
    </p>
    
     <h3>Conclusion Questions for 1.4.2</h3>
    <p>1. Absolute filenames are all inclusive. Relative filenames are a bit more specific. For example an absolute filename would include a whole tree where a relative filename would only be one branch of a tree.</p>
    <p>2. An object is a specific instance of a class with a specific set of values for its own attributes that is able to execute any methods defined in its class.</p>
    <p>3. Methods and properties for an object are basically that objects instructions and guidelines. Kind of like a list of do's and don'ts.</p>
    <p>4. When a method is called on an object that object should do whatever the method code has told it to do.</p>
