    <h2>With an explosion of technology people face new issues,
      Chapter 2 focuses on the issue of internet privacy and how
      personal information is collected by a myriad of sources, the
      chapter also explains the causes and effects of this new
      development; some being positive while others negative.Internet privacy is certainly hard to come by. Social media
      allows people to share public and "private" information about
      others. Maintaining privacy is expensive and time-consuming,
      so for most people, it's not worth it. After all, why hide from
      the public if you have nothing to hide?</h2>
      
      <h1>Branching Questions</h1>
      <h3>1. if you write a small amount of code at a time then you can easily got back to where you messed up. If you wrote a huge wall of code and
      suddenly things dont work then you have to go on a wild goose chase to find out the problem</h3>
      <h3>2.Its similar to the robotics club because usually the first design for the robot needs to be improved over and over. so much like a coding its
      a process of trial and error</h3>
      <h3>4.If it jumps back and forth between all the ifferent programs it can appear to be doing ten processes at once. I cant really think of ny other
      way how this would happen.</h3>
